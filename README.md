# rosalind-solution

This repository serves as my solution for rosalind.

## Info

- This repo is multi-language.
	- I've decided to solve this in multiple languages because I tend to
	  "language-hopping".
  -	Bazel is used to build the project, for now.
- This repo focuses on how I could express the problem and solution fluently
  -	What this means is: I try to solve this in a FP fashion, but sometimes OOP may be used, and sometimes solutions are written imperatively.
